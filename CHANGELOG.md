# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent Relay are documented here. Project Role Workflow is the legacy name used before v1.5.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-19

- Added the project-scoped Relay Runner with serial task queues, CAS claims, run logs, notifications, pause/interruption recovery, and automatic Reviewer-to-Planner reporting.
- Added Codex, OpenCode, and Claude Code non-interactive adapters with model/session contracts; unsupported tools remain manual participants.
- Added explicit initialization policy/model review, optional macOS launchd installation, versioned runtime upgrades, and bilingual Runner commands.
- Automatic `DONE` remains acceptance only and does not authorize merge, push, release, or deploy.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- `knowledge-index.md` for durable, evidence-linked architecture, constraints, decisions, and verified lessons.
- An end-to-end fresh-clone recovery test that proves committed Relay state can be recovered without bringing uncommitted files along.
- A documented, explicit handoff package for dirty working trees during machine or Agent migration.

### Changed

- Renamed the public Skill, commands, project directory, documentation, and release package from `project-role-workflow` to `agent-relay`.
- Retained a thin legacy redirect until v2.0 and made the state helper recognize old lock names without permitting ambiguous automatic release.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- First-class DeepSeek Harness (`deepseek-harness`) and OpenCode (`opencode`) tool identities in initialization, Profiles, documentation, and release validation.
- Shared-entry installation and troubleshooting guidance for both tools without duplicate Skill trees.

### Changed

- The initializer now presents nine stable tool choices, with `Other` reserved for an explicit custom ID.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Repeated, scoped Agent replacement commands in Chinese and English for current tasks, future defaults, or both.
- A Python-standard-library state helper with a short-lived local lock, expected-revision validation, atomic file replacement, and authorized stale-lock recovery.
- Per-role assignment change references and append-only MANAGEMENT records for participant changes.

### Changed

- Participant lifecycle now distinguishes `active`, reusable `standby`, and explicitly retired identities.
- Implementer replacement resets the subagent decision so the new participant must choose again.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Chinese and English commands for repository initialization and continuation.
- Project-language selection before role-tool assignment, with localized templates for Chinese and English projects.
- Implementer subagent decision gate, recorded in task state before product-code changes.
- A compact `docs/agent/protocol.md` fallback when a host prevents project-level `.agents/` installation.

### Changed

- Automatic initialization now excludes the example task from active project state.
- Project-level Skill installation degrades gracefully when the host sandbox denies `.agents/` writes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Initial Planner, Implementer, and Reviewer file-based collaboration workflow.
