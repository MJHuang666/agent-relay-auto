# Agent Collaboration Guide

This directory is the shared project context for every Agent. Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, skim `knowledge-index.md`, then read the active task `STATE.md` and `workflow.md` before working.

## Language

`PROJECT_STATUS.md.language` is the project language. Use it for communication and all new requirements, plans, execution reports, reviews, progress records, decisions, and acceptance reports. Keep file names, YAML keys, status values, participant IDs, and delivery IDs stable.

## Ownership

| File or directory | Authority |
|---|---|
| `PROJECT_STATUS.md` | Project overview and unique active task |
| `knowledge-index.md` | Compact index of durable architecture, constraints, decisions, and verified lessons |
| `tasks/<task>/STATE.md` | Task stage, participant, session, evidence, and exceptions |
| `role-bindings.md` | Participant identity and defaults |
| `roles/` | Role responsibilities and permissions |
| `profiles/` | Participant-specific agreements |
| `workflow.md` | Flow, handoff, recovery, and state rules |
| `protocol.md` | Core role and write rules when the project Skill is unavailable |
| `tasks/` | Task templates, deliverables, and append-only history |

## Continue

In the assigned tool, say `continue`. The Agent resolves its participant, checks the active task and turn, reads the knowledge index, prior handoff, and relevant sources, works only when assigned, and records evidence before handoff.

If it is not the Agent's turn, it stays read-only and reports the waiting role and participant.

## Replace an Agent

Either old or new Agent may invoke `replace agent`, `switch agent`, or the documented Chinese aliases. Choose a role and current-task/future-default/both scope, then create or reuse a same-role participant. The Python standard-library helper adds a short-lived local lock, revision validation, and atomic state replacement. Repeated A → B → A switching is supported and preserves each management record. Run `continue` separately after replacement.

Without Python the Markdown workflow remains usable in degraded manual single-writer mode. It has no technical lock or compare-and-swap protection.
